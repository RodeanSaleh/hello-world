# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub ComSci Assignment
# "Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?"
 I took this course so I can get ComSci4U next semester. When I apply to universities for mechanical engineering, my father recommended me to take this course. He told me it wouldn't hurt my chances.
# "What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features."
 I'm interested in wolfenstein and doom's influence on the FPS genre. The First-Person sprite's they used is interesting to me, however if the 3d map part is too hard, I might go for a game that has a still map, but you can move the arm or aim of the weapon around to hit the targets
